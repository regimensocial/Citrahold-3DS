# Citrahold-3DS
Citrahold is a 3DS Homebrew App, a piece of software, and a web service which allows you to easily sync your saves between 3DSes and Emulators.

**Get started, [check out the website](http://citrahold.com/)!**

- **[Download Citrahold 3DS](https://github.com/regimensocial/Citrahold-3DS/releases/latest)**  
- **[Download Citrahold PC](https://github.com/regimensocial/citraholdUI/releases/latest)**

For **developers** curious about the other repos which make this work (they don't get nearly as much attraction so I thought I'd link them):
- [Citrahold-PC](https://github.com/regimensocial/citraholdUI)
- [Citrahold-Server](https://github.com/regimensocial/Citrahold-Server)

I have future plans for Citrahold in 2025
