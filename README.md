# Citrahold-3DS
Citrahold is a 3DS Homebrew App, a piece of software, and a web service which allows you to easily sync your saves between 3DSes and Emulators.

**Citrahold is yet to fully launch! It should be ready in just a few days, please check back soon! I am currently waiting for it to be added to Universal Updater before doing a full launch, but it is fully usable now.**  

**If you want to get started early, [check out the website](http://citrahold.com/)!**

I am in the process of adding local transfer.

Also it would be an interesting idea to potentially make a Nintendo Switch port, but I do not currently have a hacked Switch.

Proper README coming soon!
