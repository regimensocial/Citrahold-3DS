# Citrahold-3DS
Citrahold is a 3DS Homebrew App, a piece of software, and a web service which allows you to easily sync your saves between 3DSes and Emulators.

**Get started, [check out the website](http://citrahold.com/)!**

For **developers** curious about the other repos which make this work (they don't get nearly as much attraction so I thought I'd link them):
- [Citrahold-PC](https://github.com/regimensocial/citraholdUI)
- [Citrahold-Server](https://github.com/regimensocial/Citrahold-Server)

I stopped actively working on Citrahold after January, but a lot more people have started using it so I may begin working on it again. It is still stable though!

I'm still yet to promote it anywhere, so not sure how you're all finding it but it's very cool!
